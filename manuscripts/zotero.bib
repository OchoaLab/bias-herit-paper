                   conducted with a single line cross. The power of such
                   QTL mapping depends highly on the two parental lines.
                   If the two lines are fixed for the same allele at a
                   putative QTL, the QTL is undetectable. On the other
                   hand, if a QTL is segregating in the line cross and
                   is detected, the estimated variance of the QTL cannot
                   be extrapolated beyond the statistical inference
                   space of the two parental lines. To reduce the
                   likelihood of missing a QTL and to increase the
                   statistical inference space of the estimated QTL
                   variance, we present a consensus QTL mapping
                   strategy. We adopt the identical by descent
                   (IBD)-based variance component method originally
                   applied to human linkage analysis by combining
                   multiple line crosses as independent families. We
                   explore the properties of consensus QTL mapping and
                   demonstrate the method with F2, backcross (BC), and
                   full-sib (FS) families. In addition, we examine the
                   effects of the QTL heritability, marker
                   informativeness, QTL position, the number of
                   families, and family size. We show that F2 families
                   notably outperform BC and FS families in detecting a
                   QTL. There is a substantial reduction in the standard
                   deviation of the estimated QTL position and the
                   separation of the QTL and polygenic variance.
                   Finally, we show that the power to detect a QTL is
                   greater when using a small number of large families
                   than a large number of small families.},

                   Association mapping, however, holds great promise if
                   true signals of functional association can be
                   separated from the vast number of false signals

                   a unified mixed-model approach to account for
                   multiple levels of relatedness simultaneously as
                   detected by random genetic markers. We applied this
                   new approach to two samples: a family-based sample of
                   14 human families, for quantitative gene expression
                   dissection, and a sample of 277 diverse maize inbred
                   lines with complex familial relationships and
                   population structure, for quantitative trait
                   dissection. Our method demonstrates improved control
                   of both type I and type II error rates over other
                   methods. As this new method crosses the boundary
                   between family-based and structured association
                   samples, it provides a powerful complement to
                   currently available methods for association mapping.},

                   association analysis, a range of methods utilizing
                   within-family variation such as
                   transmission-disequilibrium test (TDT)-based methods
                   have been developed. In scenarios where
                   stratification is not a concern, methods exploiting
                   between-family variation in addition to within-family
                   variation, such as the measured genotype (MG)
                   approach, have greater power. Application of MG
                   methods can be computationally demanding (especially
                   for large pedigrees), making genomewide scans
                   practically infeasible. Here we suggest a novel
                   approach for genomewide pedigree-based quantitative
                   trait loci (QTL) association analysis: genomewide
                   rapid association using mixed model and regression
                   (GRAMMAR). The method first obtains residuals
                   adjusted for family effects and subsequently analyzes
                   the association between these residuals and genetic
                   polymorphisms using rapid least-squares methods. At
                   the final step, the selected polymorphisms may be
                   followed up with the full measured genotype (MG)
                   analysis. In a simulation study, we compared type 1
                   error, power, and operational characteristics of the
                   proposed method with those of MG and TDT-based
                   approaches. For moderately heritable (30\%) traits in
                   human pedigrees the power of the GRAMMAR and the MG
                   approaches is similar and is much higher than that of
                   TDT-based approaches. When using tabulated
                   thresholds, the proposed method is less powerful than
                   MG for very high heritabilities and pedigrees
                   including large sibships like those observed in
                   livestock pedigrees. However, there is little or no
                   difference in empirical power of MG and the proposed
                   method. In any scenario, GRAMMAR is much faster than
                   MG and enables rapid analysis of hundreds of
                   thousands of markers.},

                   and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a
                   single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining
                   the (often distant) relationships among the study
                   subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and
                   we review methods of defining and estimating kinship
                   coefficients, both pedigree-based and marker-based.
                   In this unified framework we review solutions to the

                   such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach
                   for the identification of risk factors related to
                   human diseases. However, genetic association studies
                   in inbred model organisms are confronted by the
                   problem of complex population structure among
                   strains. This induces inflated false positive rates,
                   which cannot be corrected using standard approaches
                   applied in human association studies such as genomic
                   control or structured association. Recent studies
                   demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct
                   for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in
                   maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the
                   currently available mixed-model methods suffer from
                   computational inefficiency. In this article, we
                   propose a new method, efficient mixed-model
                   association (EMMA), which corrects for population
                   structure and genetic relatedness in model organism
                   association mapping. Our method takes advantage of
                   the specific nature of the optimization problem in
                   applying mixed models for association mapping, which
                   allows us to substantially increase the computational
                   speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA
                   to in silico whole-genome association mapping of
                   inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands
                   of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data
                   sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies
                   to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under
                   various SNP effects, varying degrees of population
                   structure, and differing numbers of multiple
                   measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of
                   inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited
                   number of available inbred strains, we are able to
                   identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall
                   into known QTL or genes identified through previous
                   studies while avoiding an inflation of false
                   positives. An R package implementation and webserver

                   have been proposed. Here, we present an efficient
                   exact method, which we refer to as genome-wide
                   efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA), that makes
                   approximations unnecessary in many contexts. This
                   method is approximately n times faster than the
                   widely used exact method known as efficient
                   mixed-model association (EMMA), where n is the sample
                   size, making exact genome-wide association analysis
                   computationally practical for large numbers of
                   individuals.},

                   cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M
                   is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an

                   Over the past 10 years, new approaches using mixed

                   effects of population structure and relatedness in

                   estimated the proportion of variance for human height
                   explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925

                   45\% of variance can be explained by considering all

                   is not missing but has not previously been detected

                   Here we report a user-friendly software tool called
                   genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was
                   developed based on a method we recently developed to
                   address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA
                   estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a
                   chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait
                   rather than testing the association of any particular
                   SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main
                   functions: data management, estimation of the genetic
                   relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis
                   of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the

                   the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X
                   chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage
                   compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool

                   genome-wide SNPs genotyped in unrelated individuals
                   has recently attracted interest and offers several
                   advantages over traditional pedigree-based methods.
                   With the use of this approach, it has been estimated
                   that over half the heritability of human height can
                   be attributed to the {\textasciitilde}300,000 SNPs on
                   a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only
                   5\%-10\% can be explained by SNPs reaching
                   genome-wide significance. We investigated via
                   simulation the validity of several key assumptions
                   underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in
                   SNP-based h(2) estimation. Although we found that the
                   method is reasonably robust to violations of four key
                   assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven
                   linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs:
                   contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal
                   variants in regions of high LD and are underestimated
                   in regions of low LD. The overall direction of the
                   bias can be up or down depending on the genetic
                   architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial
                   in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship
                   matrix in which SNPs are weighted according to local
                   LD. We show that this correction greatly reduces the
                   bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates.
                   We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first
                   seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case
                   Control Consortium. Our LD adjustment revises
                   downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related
                   diseases, as expected because of high LD in the
                   major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for
                   some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised
                   kinship matrix, we developed LDAK, software for
                   computing LD-adjusted kinships.},

                   and hidden relatedness in genome-wide case-control
                   association studies. METHODS: The new test adopts
                   beneficial traits from three existing testing
                   strategies: the principal components, mixed model,
                   and genomic control while avoiding some of their
                   disadvantageous characteristics, such as the tendency
                   of the principal components method to over-correct in
                   certain situations or the failure of the genomic
                   control approach to reorder the adjusted tests based
                   on their degree of alignment with the underlying
                   hidden structure. The new procedure is based on
                   Gauss-Markov estimators derived from a
                   straightforward linear model with an imposed variance
                   structure proportional to an empirical relatedness
                   matrix. Lastly, conceptual and analytical
                   similarities to and distinctions from other
                   approaches are emphasized throughout. RESULTS: Our
                   simulations show that the power performance of the
                   proposed test is quite promising compared to the
                   considered competing strategies. The power gains are
                   especially large when small differential differences
                   between cases and controls are present; a likely
                   scenario when public controls are used in multiple
                   studies. CONCLUSION: The proposed modified approach
                   attains high power more consistently than that of the
                   existing commonly implemented tests. Its performance
                   improvement is most apparent when small but
                   detectable systematic differences between cases and

                   conducted to identify genetic variants that influence
                   complex disorders. It is well known that failure to
                   properly account for population or pedigree structure
                   can lead to spurious association as well as reduced
                   power. We propose a method, ROADTRIPS, for
                   case-control association testing in samples with
                   partially or completely unknown population and
                   pedigree structure. ROADTRIPS uses a covariance
                   matrix estimated from genome-screen data to correct
                   for unknown population and pedigree structure while
                   maintaining high power by taking advantage of known
                   pedigree information when it is available. ROADTRIPS
                   can incorporate data on arbitrary combinations of
                   related and unrelated individuals and is
                   computationally feasible for the analysis of genetic
                   studies with millions of markers. In simulations with
                   related individuals and population structure,
                   including admixture, we demonstrate that ROADTRIPS
                   provides a substantial improvement over existing
                   methods in terms of power and type 1 error. The
                   ROADTRIPS method can be used across a variety of
                   study designs, ranging from studies that have a
                   combination of unrelated individuals and small
                   pedigrees to studies of isolated founder populations
                   with partially known or completely unknown pedigrees.
                   We apply the method to analyze two data sets: a study
                   of rheumatoid arthritis in small UK pedigrees, from
                   Genetic Analysis Workshop 15, and data from the

                   in pedigrees, but actual genome sharing can differ
                   considerably from these expected values, which in any
                   case vary according to the pedigree that happens to
                   be available. Nowadays, we can measure genome sharing
                   directly from genome-wide single-nucleotide
                   polymorphism (SNP) data; however, there are many such
                   measures in current use, and we lack good criteria
                   for choosing among them. Here, we review SNP-based
                   measures of relatedness and criteria for comparing
                   them. We discuss how useful pedigree-based concepts
                   remain today and highlight opportunities for further
                   advances in quantitative genetics, with a focus on
                   heritability estimation and phenotype prediction.},

                   modern population genetics studies in order to
                   quantitatively characterize structure and
                   relatedness. Kinship matrices have also become a
                   fundamental quantity used in genome-wide association
                   studies and heritability estimation. The most
                   frequently-used estimators of FST and kinship are
                   method-of-moments estimators whose accuracies depend
                   strongly on the existence of simple underlying forms
                   of structure, such as the independent subpopulations
                   model of non-overlapping, independently evolving
                   subpopulations. However, modern data sets have
                   revealed that these simple models of structure likely
                   do not hold in many populations, including humans. In
                   this work, we analyze the behavior of these
                   estimators in the presence of arbitrarily-complex
                   population structures, which results in an improved
                   estimation framework specifically designed for
                   arbitrary population structures. After generalizing
                   the definition of FST to arbitrary population
                   structures and establishing a framework for assessing
                   bias and consistency of genome-wide estimators, we
                   calculate the accuracy of existing FST and kinship
                   estimators under arbitrary population structures,
                   characterizing biases and estimation challenges
                   unobserved under their originally-assumed models of
                   structure. We then present our new approach, which
                   consistently estimates kinship and FST when the
                   minimum kinship value in the dataset is estimated
                   consistently. We illustrate our results using
                   simulated genotypes from an admixture model,
                   constructing a one-dimensional geographic scenario
                   that departs nontrivially from the independent

                   potential for severe biases in estimates of existing
                   approaches that are overcome by our new framework.
                   This work may significantly improve future analyses
                   that rely on accurate kinship and FST estimates.},

                   forensic identification, rely on appropriate
                   estimates of population structure or relatedness. All
                   applications require recognition that quantities with
                   an underlying meaning of allelic dependence are not
                   defined in an absolute sense, but instead are made
                   "relative to" some set of alleles other than the
                   target set. The 1984 Weir and Cockerham [Formula: see
                   text] estimate made explicit that the reference set
                   of alleles was across populations, whereas standard
                   kinship estimates do not make the reference explicit.
                   Weir and Cockerham stated that their [Formula: see
                   text] estimates were for independent populations, and
                   standard kinship estimates have an implicit
                   assumption that pairs of individuals in a study
                   sample, other than the target pair, are unrelated or
                   are not inbred. However, populations lose
                   independence when there is migration between them,
                   and dependencies between pairs of individuals in a
                   population exist for more than one target pair. We
                   have therefore recast our treatments of population
                   structure, relatedness, and inbreeding to make
                   explicit that the parameters of interest involve the
                   differences in degrees of allelic dependence between
                   the target and the reference sets of alleles, and so
                   can be negative. We take the reference set to be the
                   population from which study individuals have been
                   sampled. We provide simple moment estimates of these
                   parameters, phrased in terms of allelic matching
                   within and between individuals for relatedness and
                   inbreeding, or within and between populations for
                   population structure. A multi-level hierarchy of
                   alleles within individuals, alleles between
                   individuals within populations, and alleles between
                   populations, allows a unified treatment of
                   relatedness and population structure. We expect our
                   new measures to have a wide range of applications,
                   but we note that their estimates are sensitive to
                   rare or private variants: some
                   population-characterization applications suggest
                   exploiting those sensitivities, whereas estimation of
                   relatedness may best use all genetic markers without
                   filtering on minor allele frequency.},

                   loci (QTLs) has previously been restricted to
                   sibships and small pedigrees. In this article, we
                   show how variance-component linkage methods can be
                   used in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity,
                   and we develop a general framework for multipoint
                   identity-by-descent (IBD) probability calculations.
                   We extend the sib-pair multipoint mapping approach of
                   Fulker et al. to general relative pairs. This
                   multipoint IBD method uses the proportion of alleles
                   shared identical by descent at genotyped loci to
                   estimate IBD sharing at arbitrary points along a
                   chromosome for each relative pair. We have derived
                   correlations in IBD sharing as a function of
                   chromosomal distance for relative pairs in general
                   pedigrees and provide a simple framework whereby
                   these correlations can be easily obtained for any
                   relative pair related by a single line of descent or
                   by multiple independent lines of descent. Once
                   calculated, the multipoint relative-pair IBDs can be
                   utilized in variance-component linkage analysis,
                   which considers the likelihood of the entire pedigree
                   jointly. Examples are given that use simulated data,
                   demonstrating both the accuracy of QTL localization

                   analysis with 5-, 10-, and 20-cM marker maps. The
                   general pedigree variance component and IBD

  abstract =      {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) seek to
                   understand the relationship between complex
                   phenotype(s) (e.g., height) and up to millions of
                   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Early
                   analyses of GWASs are commonly believed to have
                   "missed" much of the additive genetic variance
                   estimated from correlations between relatives. A more
                   recent method, genome-wide complex trait analysis
                   (GCTA), obtains much higher estimates of heritability
                   using a model of random SNP effects correlated
                   between genotypically similar individuals. GCTA has
                   now been applied to many phenotypes from
                   schizophrenia to scholastic achievement. However,
                   recent studies question GCTA's estimates of
                   heritability. Here, we show that GCTA applied to
                   current SNP data cannot produce reliable or stable
                   estimates of heritability. We show first that GCTA
                   depends sensitively on all singular values of a
                   high-dimensional genetic relatedness matrix (GRM).
                   When the assumptions in GCTA are satisfied exactly,
                   we show that the heritability estimates produced by
                   GCTA will be biased and the standard errors will
                   likely be inaccurate. When the population is
                   stratified, we find that GRMs typically have highly
                   skewed singular values, and we prove that the many
                   small singular values cannot be estimated reliably.
                   Hence, GWAS data are necessarily overfit by GCTA
                   which, as a result, produces high estimates of
                   heritability. We also show that GCTA's heritability
                   estimates are sensitive to the chosen sample and to
                   measurement errors in the phenotype. We illustrate
                   our results using the Framingham dataset. Our
                   analysis suggests that results obtained using GCTA,
                   and the results' qualitative interpretations, should
                   be interpreted with great caution.},

                   likelihood (REML) estimator under a misspecified
                   linear mixed model (LMM) that has received much
                   attention in recent genome-wide association studies.
                   The asymptotic analysis establishes consistency of
                   the REML estimator of the variance of the errors in
                   the LMM, and convergence in probability of the REML
                   estimator of the variance of the random effects in
                   the LMM to a certain limit, which is equal to the
                   true variance of the random effects multiplied by the
                   limiting proportion of the nonzero random effects
                   present in the LMM. The asymptotic results also
                   establish convergence rate (in probability) of the
                   REML estimators as well as a result regarding
                   convergence of the asymptotic conditional variance of
                   the REML estimator. The asymptotic results are fully
                   supported by the results of empirical studies, which
                   include extensive simulation studies that compare the
                   performance of the REML estimator (under the
                   misspecified LMM) with other existing methods, and
                   real data applications (only one example is
                   presented) that have important genetic implications.},

                   confounding biases, such as cryptic relatedness and
                   population stratification, can yield an inflated
                   distribution of test statistics in genome-wide
                   association studies (GWAS). However, current methods
                   cannot distinguish between inflation from a true
                   polygenic signal and bias. We have developed an
                   approach, LD Score regression, that quantifies the
                   contribution of each by examining the relationship
                   between test statistics and linkage disequilibrium
                   (LD). The LD Score regression intercept can be used
                   to estimate a more powerful and accurate correction
                   factor than genomic control. We find strong evidence
                   that polygenicity accounts for the majority of the
                   inflation in test statistics in many GWAS of large
                   sample size.},

                   heritability and genetic correlations using summary
                   statistics from genome-wide association studies. The
                   key difference between SumHer and the existing
                   software LD Score Regression (LDSC) is that SumHer
                   allows the user to specify the heritability model. We
                   apply SumHer to results from 24 large-scale
                   association studies (average sample size 121,000)
                   using our recommended heritability model. We show
                   that these studies tended to substantially
                   over-correct for confounding, and as a result the
                   number of genome-wide significant loci was
                   under-reported by about a quarter. We also estimate
                   enrichments for 24 categories of SNPs defined by
                   functional annotations. A previous study using LDSC
                   reported that conserved regions were 13-fold
                   enriched, and found a further six categories with
                   above threefold enrichment. By contrast, our analysis
                   using SumHer finds that none of the categories have
                   enrichment above twofold. SumHer provides an improved
                   understanding of the genetic architecture of complex
                   traits, which enables more efficient analysis of
                   future genetic data.},

                   variance explained by SNPs, has been reported for
                   many hundreds of traits. Its estimation requires
                   strong prior assumptions about the distribution of
                   heritability across the genome, but current
                   assumptions have not been thoroughly tested. By
                   analyzing imputed data for a large number of human
                   traits, we empirically derive a model that more
                   accurately describes how heritability varies with
                   minor allele frequency (MAF), linkage disequilibrium
                   (LD) and genotype certainty. Across 19 traits, our
                   improved model leads to estimates of common SNP
                   heritability on average 43\% (s.d. 3\%) higher than
                   those obtained from the widely used software GCTA and

                   proposed extension GCTA-LDMS. Previously, DNase I
                   hypersensitivity sites were reported to explain 79\%
                   of SNP heritability; using our improved heritability
                   model, their estimated contribution is only 24\%.},
