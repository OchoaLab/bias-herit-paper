                   association studies, which arises principally because
                   of population structure and cryptic relatedness. Many
                   treatments of the problem consider only a simple
                   “island” model of population structure. We take a
                   broader approach, which views population structure
                   and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a
                   single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining
                   the (often distant) relationships among the study
                   subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and
                   we review methods of defining and estimating kinship
                   coefficients, both pedigree-based and marker-based.
                   In this unified framework we review solutions to the
                   problem of population structure, including
                   family-based study designs, genomic control,
                   structured association, regression control, principal
                   components adjustment and linear mixed models. The
                   last solution makes the most explicit use of the
                   kinships among the study subjects, and has an
                   established role in the analysis of animal and plant
                   breeding studies. Recent computational developments
                   mean that analyses of human genetic association data
                   are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for
                   association, which protect against population
                   structure and cryptic kinship, as well as
                   intermediate levels of confounding by the pedigree.},

                   genetic association models for human studies},

  abstract =      {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Linear
                   Mixed-effects Model (LMM), sometimes in combination,
                   are the most common modern models for genetic
                   association. Previous PCA-LMM comparisons give mixed
                   results and unclear guidance, and have several
                   limitations, including not varying the number of
                   principal components (PCs), simulating overly simple
                   population structures, and inconsistent use of real
                   data and power evaluations. In this work, we
                   thoroughly evaluate PCA and LMM both with varying
                   number of PCs in new realistic genotype and complex
                   trait simulations including admixed families, trees,
                   and large real multiethnic human genotype datasets
                   (1000 Genomes Project, the Human Genome Diversity
                   Panel, and Human Origins) with simulated traits. We
                   find that LMM without PCs performs best in all cases,
                   with the largest effects in the family simulation and
                   all real human datasets. We determined that the large
                   gaps in PCA to LMM performance on the real human
                   datasets is due to the high-dimensional family
                   structure stemming from large numbers of distant
                   relatives, and not from the smaller number of highly
                   related pairs. While it was known that PCA fails on
                   family data, here we report a strong effect on
                   association of cryptic family relatedness in several
                   genetically diverse human datasets, a problem that is
                   not avoided with the common practice of pruning
                   high-relatedness individual pairs. Overall, this work
                   better characterizes the severe limitations of PCA
                   compared to LMM in modeling the complex relatedness
                   structures present in real multiethnic human data and
                   its impact in association studies.},

                   modern population genetics studies in order to
                   quantitatively characterize structure and
                   relatedness. Kinship matrices have also become a
                   fundamental quantity used in genome-wide association
                   studies and heritability estimation. The most
                   frequently-used estimators of FST and kinship are
                   method-of-moments estimators whose accuracies depend
                   strongly on the existence of simple underlying forms
                   of structure, such as the independent subpopulations
                   model of non-overlapping, independently evolving
                   subpopulations. However, modern data sets have
                   revealed that these simple models of structure likely
                   do not hold in many populations, including humans. In
                   this work, we analyze the behavior of these
                   estimators in the presence of arbitrarily-complex
                   population structures, which results in an improved
                   estimation framework specifically designed for
                   arbitrary population structures. After generalizing
                   the definition of FST to arbitrary population
                   structures and establishing a framework for assessing
                   bias and consistency of genome-wide estimators, we
                   calculate the accuracy of existing FST and kinship
                   estimators under arbitrary population structures,
                   characterizing biases and estimation challenges
                   unobserved under their originally-assumed models of
                   structure. We then present our new approach, which
                   consistently estimates kinship and FST when the
                   minimum kinship value in the dataset is estimated
                   consistently. We illustrate our results using
                   simulated genotypes from an admixture model,
                   constructing a one-dimensional geographic scenario
                   that departs nontrivially from the independent
                   subpopulations model. Our simulations reveal the
                   potential for severe biases in estimates of existing
                   approaches that are overcome by our new framework.
                   This work may significantly improve future analyses
                   that rely on accurate kinship and FST estimates.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case-control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

	abstract = {Case-control association studies are widely used in the search for genetic variants that contribute to human diseases. It has long been known that such studies may suffer from high rates of false positives if there is unrecognized population structure. It is perhaps less widely appreciated that so-called “cryptic relatedness” (i.e., kinship among the cases or controls that is not known to the investigator) might also potentially inflate the false positive rate. Until now there has been little work to assess how serious this problem is likely to be in practice. In this paper, we develop a formal model of cryptic relatedness, and study its impact on association studies. We provide simple expressions that predict the extent of confounding due to cryptic relatedness. Surprisingly, these expressions are functions of directly observable parameters. Our analytical results show that, for well-designed studies in outbred populations, the degree of confounding due to cryptic relatedness will usually be negligible. However, in contrast, studies where there is a sampling bias toward collecting relatives may indeed suffer from excessive rates of false positives. Furthermore, cryptic relatedness may be a serious concern in founder populations that have grown rapidly and recently from a small size. As an example, we analyze the impact of excess relatedness among cases for six phenotypes measured in the Hutterite population.},

                   conducted with a single line cross. The power of such
                   QTL mapping depends highly on the two parental lines.
                   If the two lines are fixed for the same allele at a
                   putative QTL, the QTL is undetectable. On the other
                   hand, if a QTL is segregating in the line cross and
                   is detected, the estimated variance of the QTL cannot
                   be extrapolated beyond the statistical inference
                   space of the two parental lines. To reduce the
                   likelihood of missing a QTL and to increase the
                   statistical inference space of the estimated QTL
                   variance, we present a consensus QTL mapping
                   strategy. We adopt the identical by descent
                   (IBD)-based variance component method originally
                   applied to human linkage analysis by combining
                   multiple line crosses as independent families. We
                   explore the properties of consensus QTL mapping and
                   demonstrate the method with F2, backcross (BC), and
                   full-sib (FS) families. In addition, we examine the
                   effects of the QTL heritability, marker
                   informativeness, QTL position, the number of
                   families, and family size. We show that F2 families
                   notably outperform BC and FS families in detecting a
                   QTL. There is a substantial reduction in the standard
                   deviation of the estimated QTL position and the
                   separation of the QTL and polygenic variance.
                   Finally, we show that the power to detect a QTL is
                   greater when using a small number of large families
                   than a large number of small families.},

                   between-family variation in addition to within-family
                   variation, such as the measured genotype (MG)
                   approach, have greater power. Application of MG
                   methods can be computationally demanding (especially
                   for large pedigrees), making genomewide scans
                   practically infeasible. Here we suggest a novel
                   approach for genomewide pedigree-based quantitative
                   trait loci (QTL) association analysis: genomewide
                   rapid association using mixed model and regression
                   (GRAMMAR). The method first obtains residuals
                   adjusted for family effects and subsequently analyzes
                   the association between these residuals and genetic
                   polymorphisms using rapid least-squares methods. At
                   the final step, the selected polymorphisms may be
                   followed up with the full measured genotype (MG)
                   analysis. In a simulation study, we compared type 1
                   error, power, and operational characteristics of the
                   proposed method with those of MG and TDT-based
                   approaches. For moderately heritable (30\%) traits in
                   human pedigrees the power of the GRAMMAR and the MG
                   approaches is similar and is much higher than that of
                   TDT-based approaches. When using tabulated
                   thresholds, the proposed method is less powerful than
                   MG for very high heritabilities and pedigrees
                   including large sibships like those observed in
                   livestock pedigrees. However, there is little or no
                   difference in empirical power of MG and the proposed
                   method. In any scenario, GRAMMAR is much faster than
                   MG and enables rapid analysis of hundreds of
                   thousands of markers.},

                   such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach
                   for the identification of risk factors related to
                   human diseases. However, genetic association studies
                   in inbred model organisms are confronted by the
                   problem of complex population structure among
                   strains. This induces inflated false positive rates,
                   which cannot be corrected using standard approaches
                   applied in human association studies such as genomic
                   control or structured association. Recent studies
                   demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct
                   for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in
                   maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the
                   currently available mixed-model methods suffer from
                   computational inefficiency. In this article, we
                   propose a new method, efficient mixed-model
                   association (EMMA), which corrects for population
                   structure and genetic relatedness in model organism
                   association mapping. Our method takes advantage of
                   the specific nature of the optimization problem in
                   applying mixed models for association mapping, which
                   allows us to substantially increase the computational
                   speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA
                   to in silico whole-genome association mapping of
                   inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands
                   of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data
                   sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies
                   to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under
                   various SNP effects, varying degrees of population
                   structure, and differing numbers of multiple
                   measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of
                   inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited
                   number of available inbred strains, we are able to
                   identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall
                   into known QTL or genes identified through previous
                   studies while avoiding an inflation of false
                   positives. An R package implementation and webserver
                   of our EMMA method are publicly available.},

                   control approach to reorder the adjusted tests based
                   on their degree of alignment with the underlying
                   hidden structure. The new procedure is based on
                   Gauss-Markov estimators derived from a
                   straightforward linear model with an imposed variance
                   structure proportional to an empirical relatedness
                   matrix. Lastly, conceptual and analytical
                   similarities to and distinctions from other
                   approaches are emphasized throughout. RESULTS: Our
                   simulations show that the power performance of the
                   proposed test is quite promising compared to the
                   considered competing strategies. The power gains are
                   especially large when small differential differences
                   between cases and controls are present; a likely
                   scenario when public controls are used in multiple
                   studies. CONCLUSION: The proposed modified approach
                   attains high power more consistently than that of the
                   existing commonly implemented tests. Its performance
                   improvement is most apparent when small but
                   detectable systematic differences between cases and
                   controls exist.},

  abstract =      {Genome-wide association studies are routinely
                   conducted to identify genetic variants that influence
                   complex disorders. It is well known that failure to
                   properly account for population or pedigree structure
                   can lead to spurious association as well as reduced
                   power. We propose a method, ROADTRIPS, for
                   case-control association testing in samples with
                   partially or completely unknown population and
                   pedigree structure. ROADTRIPS uses a covariance
                   matrix estimated from genome-screen data to correct
                   for unknown population and pedigree structure while
                   maintaining high power by taking advantage of known
                   pedigree information when it is available. ROADTRIPS
                   can incorporate data on arbitrary combinations of
                   related and unrelated individuals and is
                   computationally feasible for the analysis of genetic
                   studies with millions of markers. In simulations with
                   related individuals and population structure,
                   including admixture, we demonstrate that ROADTRIPS
                   provides a substantial improvement over existing
                   methods in terms of power and type 1 error. The
                   ROADTRIPS method can be used across a variety of
                   study designs, ranging from studies that have a
                   combination of unrelated individuals and small
                   pedigrees to studies of isolated founder populations
                   with partially known or completely unknown pedigrees.
                   We apply the method to analyze two data sets: a study
                   of rheumatoid arthritis in small UK pedigrees, from
                   Genetic Analysis Workshop 15, and data from the
                   Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism on
                   alcohol dependence in a sample of moderate-size
                   pedigrees of European descent, from Genetic Analysis
                   Workshop 14. We detect genome-wide significant

                   populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We
                   estimated the proportion of variance for human height
                   explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925

                   45\% of variance can be explained by considering all

                   is not missing but has not previously been detected

                   genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having

                   genome-wide SNPs genotyped in unrelated individuals
                   has recently attracted interest and offers several
                   advantages over traditional pedigree-based methods.
                   With the use of this approach, it has been estimated
                   that over half the heritability of human height can
                   be attributed to the {\textasciitilde}300,000 SNPs on
                   a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only
                   5\%-10\% can be explained by SNPs reaching
                   genome-wide significance. We investigated via
                   simulation the validity of several key assumptions
                   underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in
                   SNP-based h(2) estimation. Although we found that the
                   method is reasonably robust to violations of four key
                   assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven
                   linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs:
                   contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal
                   variants in regions of high LD and are underestimated
                   in regions of low LD. The overall direction of the
                   bias can be up or down depending on the genetic
                   architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial
                   in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship
                   matrix in which SNPs are weighted according to local
                   LD. We show that this correction greatly reduces the
                   bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates.
                   We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first
                   seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case
                   Control Consortium. Our LD adjustment revises
                   downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related
                   diseases, as expected because of high LD in the
                   major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for
                   some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised
                   kinship matrix, we developed LDAK, software for
                   computing LD-adjusted kinships.},

                   specify expected genome sharing between individuals
                   in pedigrees, but actual genome sharing can differ
                   considerably from these expected values, which in any

                   forensic identification, rely on appropriate
                   estimates of population structure or relatedness. All
                   applications require recognition that quantities with
                   an underlying meaning of allelic dependence are not
                   defined in an absolute sense, but instead are made
                   "relative to" some set of alleles other than the
                   target set. The 1984 Weir and Cockerham [Formula: see
                   text] estimate made explicit that the reference set
                   of alleles was across populations, whereas standard
                   kinship estimates do not make the reference explicit.
                   Weir and Cockerham stated that their [Formula: see
                   text] estimates were for independent populations, and
                   standard kinship estimates have an implicit
                   assumption that pairs of individuals in a study
                   sample, other than the target pair, are unrelated or
                   are not inbred. However, populations lose
                   independence when there is migration between them,
                   and dependencies between pairs of individuals in a
                   population exist for more than one target pair. We
                   have therefore recast our treatments of population
                   structure, relatedness, and inbreeding to make
                   explicit that the parameters of interest involve the
                   differences in degrees of allelic dependence between
                   the target and the reference sets of alleles, and so
                   can be negative. We take the reference set to be the
                   population from which study individuals have been
                   sampled. We provide simple moment estimates of these
                   parameters, phrased in terms of allelic matching
                   within and between individuals for relatedness and
                   inbreeding, or within and between populations for
                   population structure. A multi-level hierarchy of
                   alleles within individuals, alleles between
                   individuals within populations, and alleles between
                   populations, allows a unified treatment of
                   relatedness and population structure. We expect our
                   new measures to have a wide range of applications,
                   but we note that their estimates are sensitive to
                   rare or private variants: some
                   population-characterization applications suggest
                   exploiting those sensitivities, whereas estimation of
                   relatedness may best use all genetic markers without
                   filtering on minor allele frequency.},

                   are present in this data set. On average, each person
                   is found to carry approximately 250 to 300
                   loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50
                   to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited
                   disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be
                   used to inform association and functional studies.
                   From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of
                   de novo germline base substitution mutations to be
                   approximately 10−8 per base pair per generation. We
                   explore the data with regard to signatures of natural
                   selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic
                   variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to
                   selection at linked sites. These methods and public

                   Project aims to build a resource to help to
                   understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here
                   we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14
                   populations, constructed using a combination of
                   low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By
                   developing methods to integrate information across
                   several algorithms and diverse data sources, we
                   provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million
                   single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short
                   insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger
                   deletions. We show that individuals from different
                   populations carry different profiles of rare and
                   common variants, and that low-frequency variants show
                   substantial geographic differentiation, which is
                   further increased by the action of purifying
                   selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and
                   coding consequence are key determinants of the
                   strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant
                   load varies substantially across biological pathways,
                   and that each individual contains hundreds of rare
                   non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as
                   motif-disrupting changes in
                   transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource,

                   related populations, enables analysis of common and

                   variance explained by SNPs, has been reported for
                   many hundreds of traits. Its estimation requires
                   strong prior assumptions about the distribution of
                   heritability across the genome, but current
                   assumptions have not been thoroughly tested. By
                   analyzing imputed data for a large number of human

                   accurately describes how heritability varies with
                   minor allele frequency (MAF), linkage disequilibrium
                   (LD) and genotype certainty. Across 19 traits, our
                   improved model leads to estimates of common SNP
                   heritability on average 43\% (s.d. 3\%) higher than

                   population differentiation, and other factors, in
                   forensic inference based on DNA profiles. Much
                   current forensic practice ignores, for example, the
                   effects of coancestry and inappropriate databases and
                   is consequently systematically biased against
                   defendants. Problems with the 'product rule' for
                   forensic identification have been highlighted by
                   several authors, but important aspects of the
                   problems are not widely appreciated. This arises in
                   part because the match probability has often been
                   confused with the relative frequency of the profile.
                   Further, the analogous problems in paternity cases
                   have received little attention. The proposed method
                   is derived under general assumptions about the
                   underlying population genetic processes.
                   Probabilities relevant to forensic inference are
                   expressed in terms of a single parameter whose values
                   can be chosen to reflect the specific circumstances.
                   The method is currently used in some UK courts and
                   has important advantages over the 'Ceiling Principle'
                   method, which has been criticized on a number of

                   confounding factors in genome-wide association
                   studies (GWAS). It has been standard practice to
                   include principal components of the genotypes in a
                   regression model in order to account for population
                   structure. More recently, the linear mixed model
                   (LMM) has emerged as a powerful method for
                   simultaneously accounting for population structure
                   and kinship. The statistical theory underlying the
                   differences in empirical performance between modeling
                   principal components as fixed versus random effects
                   has not been thoroughly examined. We undertake an
                   analysis to formalize the relationship between these
                   widely used methods and elucidate the statistical
                   properties of each. Moreover, we introduce a new
                   statistic, effective degrees of freedom, that serves
                   as a metric of model complexity and a novel low rank

                   through simulations. A comparison of the results of
                   LRLMM and a standard LMM analysis applied to GWAS
                   data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis

                   of the LRLMM to substantially boost the strength of

Previous recursive procedures based on the generalized coefficients of kinship provided the detailed coefficients of identity under the assumption that the two individuals were not an ancestor of each other. By using gametic relationships to include three, four or two pairs of gametes, we can obtain these coefficients for any pair of individuals. We have developed a novel linear transformation that allows for the calculation of pairwise detailed identity coefficients for any pedigree given the gametic relationships. We illustrate the procedure using the well-known pedigree of Julio and Mencha, which contains 20 Jicaque Indians of Honduras, to calculate their detailed coefficients. The proposed algorithm can be used to calculate the detailed identity coefficients of two or more individuals with any pedigree relationship.},

	abstract = {In a pair of seminal papers, Sewall Wright and Gustave Malécot introduced FST as a measure of structure in natural populations. In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed-in some cases more than twofold-when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify these issues and propose solutions.},

	abstract = {We study high-dimensional sample covariance matrices based on independent random vectors with missing coordinates. The presence of missing observations is common in modern applications such as climate studies or gene expression micro-arrays. A weak approximation on the spectral distribution in the “large dimension \$d\$ and large sample size \$n\$” asymptotics is derived for possibly different observation probabilities in the coordinates. The spectral distribution turns out to be strongly influenced by the missingness mechanism. In the null case under the missing at random scenario where each component is observed with the same probability \$p\$, the limiting spectral distribution is a Marčenko–Pastur law shifted by \$(1-p)/p\$ to the left. As \$d/n{\textbackslash}rightarrow y{\textbackslash}in(0,1)\$, the almost sure convergence of the extremal eigenvalues to the respective boundary points of the support of the limiting spectral distribution is proved, which are explicitly given in terms of \$y\$ and \$p\$. Eventually, the sample covariance matrix is positive definite if \$p\$ is larger than {\textbackslash}[1-(1-{\textbackslash}sqrt\{y\}){\textasciicircum}\{2\},{\textbackslash}] whereas this is not true any longer if \$p\$ is smaller than this quantity.},

                   general pedigrees},
  volume =        {62},
  year =          {1998},
  abstract =      {Multipoint linkage analysis of quantitative-trait
                   loci (QTLs) has previously been restricted to
                   sibships and small pedigrees. In this article, we
                   show how variance-component linkage methods can be
                   used in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity,
                   and we develop a general framework for multipoint
                   identity-by-descent (IBD) probability calculations.
                   We extend the sib-pair multipoint mapping approach of
                   Fulker et al. to general relative pairs. This
                   multipoint IBD method uses the proportion of alleles
                   shared identical by descent at genotyped loci to
                   estimate IBD sharing at arbitrary points along a
                   chromosome for each relative pair. We have derived
                   correlations in IBD sharing as a function of
                   chromosomal distance for relative pairs in general
                   pedigrees and provide a simple framework whereby
                   these correlations can be easily obtained for any
                   relative pair related by a single line of descent or
                   by multiple independent lines of descent. Once
                   calculated, the multipoint relative-pair IBDs can be
                   utilized in variance-component linkage analysis,
                   which considers the likelihood of the entire pedigree
                   jointly. Examples are given that use simulated data,
                   demonstrating both the accuracy of QTL localization
                   and the increase in power provided by multipoint
                   analysis with 5-, 10-, and 20-cM marker maps. The
                   general pedigree variance component and IBD
                   estimation methods have been implemented in the SOLAR
                   (Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines)

	abstract = {Background: The kinship2 package is restructured from the previous kinship package. Existing features are now enhanced and new features added for handling pedigree objects. Methods: Pedigree plotting features have been updated to display features on complex pedigrees while adhering to pedigree plotting standards. Kinship matrices can now be calculated for the X chromosome. Other methods have been added to subset and trim pedigrees while maintaining the pedigree structure. Conclusion: We make the kinship2 package available for R on the Contributed R Archives Network ({CRAN}), where data management is built-in and other packages can use the pedigree object.},
